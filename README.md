issuetracker is an API provided by SoftDesk that facilitates project management and issue tracking.

It allows users, including project managers and contributors, to create projects and manage associated issues. Issues can be assigned to project contributors, and any contributor can comment on them. Additionally, all project contributors can track the status of each issue within the project.

This API is compatible with Android, iOS, and web applications.

By utilizing the API endpoints, users of these applications can design various projects, add users to specific projects, create issues within projects, and categorize them based on priorities, tags, assignees, and status.
